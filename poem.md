  **You'll Love Me Yet**

  >You'll love me yet! and I can tarry
  Your love's protracted growing:
  June reared that bunch of flowers you carry
  From seeds of April's sowing.

  >I plant a heartful now: some seed
  At least is sure to strike,
  And yield, what you'll not pluck indeed,
  Not love, but, may be, like!

  >You'll look at least on love's remains,
  A grave's one violet:
  Your look? that pays a thousand pains.
  What's death? _You'll love me yet!_
